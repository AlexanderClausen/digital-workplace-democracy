## Abstract
Technology has rapidly changed nearly all aspects of our lives in the past few decades. It has also changed how we receive news, how we interact with democratic representatives, and how we vote. The way we work is also changing, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not only have more flexibility to work from anywhere and at any time. Many employees have also started questioning their jobs, seeking more purpose at work. A participatory work environment can help achieve that. This thesis aims to find out which aspects of Digital Democracy can be applied to the workplace, which aspects of Workplace Democracy can be digitalized, and how valuable this is for organizations. To answer these questions, prior research from the fields of Digital Democracy and Workplace Democracy are analyzed. Possible advantages and disadvantages, criteria for the successful implementation, potential objectives, and corresponding approaches and KPIs are identified in the thesis. The thesis concludes that Digital Workplace Democracy can be valuable especially for large organizations if certain preconditions are met. To verify the results of this theoretical, literature-based thesis, further research is required.
