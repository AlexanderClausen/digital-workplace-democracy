 abstract = {Erh{\"o}hte Responsivit{\"a}t und Transparenz der Politik geh{\"o}ren zu den wichtigsten Versprechen, die eine {\glqq}Demokratie~2.0{\grqq} einzul{\"o}sen verspricht. In diesem Zusammenhang sind im letzten Jahrzehnt eine Reihe von Parliamentary Monitoring Organisations (PMO) entstanden, welche neue, innovative M{\"o}glichkeiten der politischen Kommunikation zwischen B{\"u}rgern und Politikern aufgezeigt und die Hoffnung nach einer Revitalisierung der repr{\"a}sentativen Demokratie gen{\"a}hrt haben. Solche Organisation stellen die Infrastruktur f{\"u}r Transparenz und Responsivit{\"a}t bereit, indem sie Big Data {\"u}ber das parlamentarische Verhalten einzelner Abgeordneten aggregieren, diese f{\"u}r die {\"O}ffentlichkeit aufbereiten und B{\"u}rgern die M{\"o}glichkeit bieten, mit Abgeordneten in Kontakt zu treten. Am Beispiel des von der PMO Abgeordnetenwatch.de j{\"a}hrlich erstellten Abgeordnetenrankings erl{\"a}utert dieser Beitrag die Responsivit{\"a}t von Bundestagsabgeordneten der 17.~Legislaturperiode auf digital vermittelte Anfragen von B{\"u}rgern. Die Ergebnisse der Untersuchung zeigen, dass parlamentarische und gouvernamentale Positionsrollen, wie die Zugeh{\"o}rigkeit zu einer Oppositionspartei oder die Mitgliedschaft in der Bundesregierung, sowie die Abwesenheit von Abgeordneten im Bundestag wichtige Faktoren f{\"u}r die Erkl{\"a}rung der Responsivit{\"a}t von MdBs sind. Auch geht vom Ranking selbst ein wichtiger Einfluss aus, da schlecht abschneidende Abgeordnete besonders bem{\"u}ht sind, ihre Position im n{\"a}chsten Jahr zu verbessern. Abschlie{\ss}end wird die Passf{\"a}higkeit solcher Rankings f{\"u}r arbeitsteilig organisierte Parlamente diskutiert.},

@misc{CenterforLearninginAction.20210524,
 abstract = {Workplace democracy is generally understood as the application of democratic practices, such as voting, debate and participatory decision-making systems, to the workplace. There are many ways to do this, some much more ambitious than others. At one extreme lie small firms and non-profits that have embraced pure, direct democracy. This is unwieldy in any but the smallest firms, since more time would be spent deciding than doing. At the other extreme lie firms where executives follow recent management fads and exhort employees to ``feel like owners,'' but then do very little else. In the middle we find firms where the processes of workplace democracy aid the success of the business. The best examples have been distilled into what a noted expert calls the ``equity model'' of employee ownership (Rosen et al.). A key part of this approach is the relationship between participatory management and employee stock ownership. According to a recent summary, ``the combination of ownership and{\&}nbsp;participatory management is a powerful competitive tool. Neither ownership nor participation alone, however, accomplish very much.'' (http://www.nceo.org/library/corpperf.html). What is employee ownership? It simply means that the people who work for a company own some or all of it. Among the kinds of employee ownership (partnership, cooperative, etc.), the most common method of ownership is the{\&}nbsp;employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) , through which employees own shares in their company. Use the resources to the right to answer the following questions: How widespread is participatory employee ownership (``the equity model'') in the U.S.? Why is it not more common? Next {\frqq}},

@article{Kerr.2004,
 abstract = {[Despite decades of encouragement from theorists and consultants, managers have generally not embraced democratic process as a system of management and decision-making in organizations. While it is tempting to explain this state of affairs in terms of managers' reluctance to share power, this article considers the possibility that democracy's limited success is due to its own limitations as a system of organizational governance. The article questions two common assumptions: (a) that political democracy provides a useful model for organizational democracy, and (b) that democratic process is applicable in all organizations. Close analysis suggests that political democracy provides little guidance for organizational democracy because its essential characteristics--accountability to the governed, right of participation, free exchange of information, and right of representation--are rarely, if ever, supported in organizations. Furthermore, the basic function of political democracy--legitimization of authority--has no counterpart in organizations. As for applicability, the article argues that democratic process can only be successfully implemented where it contributes significantly to competitive advantage and organizational performance. This depends on several contingency variables, including the nature of the organization's products and services, the characteristics of its workforce, and the degree of hierarchical resistance to redistribution of power and control.]},

@book{Korthagen.2018,
 abstract = {Digital tools could create stronger connections between European citizens and the EU decision-making process and, by doing so, might contribute to reducing the EU democratic deficit. This report investigates what lessons can be drawn from local, national and European experiences of the use of digital tools for the functioning of EU decision-making procedures and institutions. For that purpose, a review of current literature on e-democracy and the European public sphere has been carried out; 22 local, national and EU experiences with existing digital tools have been investigated and evaluated; and an analysis has been made of the suitability of the most promising digital tools for implementation and use at EU level. The most important factors for successful e-participation identified in the report are: a close and clear link between e-participation processes and a concrete formal decision-making process; the participatory process and the contribution of its outputs to the overall decision-making process have to be clear to participants from the start; feedback to the participants about what has been done with their contributions is an indispensable feature of the process; a participative process should not be limited to one event but should be imbedded in an institutional 'culture of participation'; e-participation must be accompanied by an effective mobilisation and engagement strategy, involving communication instruments tailored for different target groups.},

These numbers are rapidly increasing (World Health Organization, May 3, 2020c). There is much concern during this pandemic about the spread of misleading or inaccurate information. This article reports on a small study which attempted to identify the types and sources of COVID-19 misinformation. The authors identified and analysed 1225 pieces of COVID-19 fake news stories taken from fact-checkers, myth-busters and COVID-19 dashboards. The study is significant given the concern raised by the WHO Director-General that 'we are not just fighting the pandemic, we are also fighting infodemic'. The study concludes that the COVID-19 infodemic is full of false claims, half backed conspiracy theories and pseudoscientific therapies, regarding the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, origin and spread of the virus. Fake news is pervasive in social media, putting public health at risk. The scale of the crisis and ubiquity of the misleading information require that scientists, health information professionals and journalists exercise their professional responsibility to help the general public identify fake news stories. They should ensure that accurate information is published and disseminated.J.M.},

We innovate by analyzing whether and to what extent the availability of e-voting fosters turnout among specific groups of citizens, and how this influences the equality of participation. To that end, we estimate Bayesian multi-level models on a unique set of official data on citizens' participation covering 30 ballots between 2008 and 2016 in Geneva, Switzerland, which has the most far-reaching experience with e-voting worldwide. Despite the fact that e-voting was added to an easy-to-use form of postal voting, we find that offering e-voting has increased turnout among abstainers and occasional voters. By contrast, the effects of e-voting availability on the equality of participation are mixed with respect to the age cohorts and gender.},

 abstract = {Digital technology brings greater efficiency in many walks of life, and elections are no exception. Online databases hugely facilitate the task of creating and managing accurate and up-to-date electoral rolls. In less developed countries, whose citizens often lack reliable identity documents, biometric technology can help to identify voters, thus preventing fraud in the form of multiple voting. However, for some aspects of election management, digitalisation is more controversial. Electronic voting machines count votes quickly and accurately. First used in the United States, they have spread to several Latin American and Asian countries. However, the intangible nature of digital processes makes detecting tampering more difficult; as a result, most European countries are sticking to tried-and-trusted conventional paper ballots. Even more controversial is the idea of internet voting. On the one hand, allowing citizens the convenience of casting their vote online without the need to visit polling stations could help to reverse a worrying decline in voter turnout across the world. On the other hand, current technology does not allow internet voting systems to be fully secured against hackers, a major concern given the growing sophistication of cyber-attacks (for example, from Russia). To date, only Estonia gives all voters the option of online voting in national elections.},

Os resultados apontam que os aspectos discursivos concernentes {\`a} reciprocidade e {\`a} reflexividade se mostraram relativamente escassos; entretanto, o respeito pelos outros interlocutores, bem como a constru{\c{c}}{\~a}o da justificativa dos pontos de vista expressos no f{\'o}rum, alcan{\c{c}}aram {\'i}ndices elevados, mesmo n{\~a}o havendo empowerment da ferramenta ou incentivo por parte da Prefeitura. Conclui-se que a internet pode, efetivamente, oferecer ambientes voltados para o estabelecimento de trocas discursivas qualificadas e que, mesmo nos casos onde h{\'a} baixos {\'i}ndices de deliberatividade, h{\'a} progressos importantes do ponto de vista do aprendizado a que s{\~a}o expostos os usu{\'a}rios.},
